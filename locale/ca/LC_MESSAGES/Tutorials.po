"The Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin uses SAGA GIS for the "
"classification process. The SAGA algorithms work only with single band "
"images as input. Therefore, if input is a multi band raster (i.e. a single "
"image file made of several bands), the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin "
"automatically splits the input file to single band rasters, which takes some"
" time depending on raster size. In order to optimize the classification "
"process (especially for hyperspectral images), it is preferable to use "
"single band rasters, or split the image file to single bands, as explained "
