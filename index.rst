  <br />

The **Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin** is a free plugin for `QGIS <http://www.qgis.org>`_ (open source) that allows for the **semi-automatic supervised classification** of remote sensing images, providing tools to expedite the creation of ROIs, the pre processing phases (image clipping, Landsat conversion to reflectance), the classification process, and the post processing phases (accuracy assessment, land cover change).

Written by Luca Congedo for the `Adapting to Climate Change in Coastal Dar es Salaam Project <http://www.planning4adaptation.eu/>`_.
This plugin requires the installation of `SAGA GIS <http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html>`_, `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ and `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_. The plugin can be downloaded from the QGIS Plugin Repository.
