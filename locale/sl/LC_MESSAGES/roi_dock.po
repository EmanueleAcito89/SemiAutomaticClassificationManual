"The ROI creation dock is designed for the definition of an **input** image "
"(which can be a single multiband raster or set of single band rasters) and a"
" **training shapefile**, and for the creation of **ROIs** using a **region "
"growing** algorithm or **manual drawing**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../roi_dock.rst:17
msgid ""
"ROIs (Regions Of Interest) are polygons that can be created automatically "
"using a region growing algorithm (i.e. image is segmented around a pixel "
"seed), by clicking on an image pixel. This way, created ROIs include "
"spectrally homogeneous pixels. Alternatively, ROIs can be created manually "
"by drawing a polygon. Created ROIs are temporary polygons, until they are "
"saved in the training shapefile, which are placed inside a group named "
"``Class_temp_group`` , and deleted when the QGIS project is closed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../roi_dock.rst:19

"ROIs are then saved in a training shapefile, created by the plugin, which "
"contains several fields required for the classification process."

#: ../../roi_dock.rst:21
msgid ""
"ROIs are defined with a Class ID, a Macroclass ID and additional Information"
" (i.e. class description). The Class ID is a unique identifier for each land"
" cover class. A macroclass is a group of ROIs having different Class ID, "
"which is useful when one needs to classify materials that have different "
"spectral signatures in the same land cover class. For instance we could "
"classify grass (e.g. ``ID class = 1`` and ``Macroclass ID = 1`` ) and trees "
"(e.g. ``ID class = 2`` and ``Macroclass ID = 1`` ) as a vegetation class "
"(e.g. ``Macroclass ID = 1`` ). The use of the Macroclass ID for "
"classifications is defined with the option ``Use Macroclass ID`` in the "
":ref:`classification_dock`. If the option ``Use Macroclass ID`` is "
"unchecked, then the classification is performed using the ID class only "
"(e.g. grass and trees are classified as class 1 and 2 respectively). If one "
"does not need macroclasses, simply assign the same Macroclass ID to all ROIs"
" (e.g. 1) and uncheck the option ``Use Macroclass ID``. Each Class ID must "
"be assigned to only one Macroclass ID (i.e. each class can have only one "
"macroclass), but several Class IDs can be assigned to the same Macroclass ID"
" (i.e. different classes can have the same macroclass). Of course, several "
"ROIs can share the same Class ID."
