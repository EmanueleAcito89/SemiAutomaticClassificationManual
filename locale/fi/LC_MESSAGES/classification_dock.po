"The Classification dock implements the process of **classification** of the "
"image (or only a preview), with several functions for **vector output**, "
"**accuracy assessment** and **classification reports**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classification_dock.rst:17

"The Classification dock allows for the semi-automatic classification of a "
"remote sensing image (or a band set), using the supervised classification "
"algorithms provided by the SAGA GIS (through the Processing plugin)."

msgid ""
"The classification process requires a training shapefile containing the ROIs"
" used for the definition of land cover classes (see the :ref:`roi_dock`). It"
" is possible to use the Macroclass ID or Class ID for classifications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classification_dock.rst:21
msgid ""
"The classification can be performed for the entire image, or for a portion "
"of it, creating a classification preview. Similarly to ROI creation, "
"classification previews are created using the preview pointer, and a click "
"on an image pixel; preview classifications are temporarily placed inside a "
"layer group named ``Class_temp_group``, and they are deleted after that the "
"QGIS session is stopped."
