"The program \"System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses\" (SAGA) version "
"2.1.0 is unavailable for Mac OS, therefore the Semi-Automatic Classification"
" Plugin for QGIS is unable to run. |br| It is possible to compile SAGA on "
"Mac OS following the guide `here <http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/saga-"
"gis/wiki/Compiling%20SAGA%20on%20Mac%20OS%20X>`_, although this can be "
"problematic. |br| As a solution, it is possible to use a free virtual "
"machine, which has the required software already installed (see the Semi-"
"Automatic OS chapter)."
