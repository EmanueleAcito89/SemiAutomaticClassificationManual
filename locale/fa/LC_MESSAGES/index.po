"The **Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin** is a free plugin for `QGIS "
"<http://www.qgis.org>`_ (open source) that allows for the **semi-automatic "
"supervised classification** of remote sensing images, providing tools to "
"expedite the creation of ROIs, the pre processing phases (image clipping, "
"Landsat conversion to reflectance), the classification process, and the post"
" processing phases (accuracy assessment, land cover change)."
