The program "System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses" (SAGA) version 2.1.0 is unavailable for Mac OS, therefore the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin for QGIS is unable to run.
|br|
It is possible to compile SAGA on Mac OS following the guide `here <http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/saga-gis/wiki/Compiling%20SAGA%20on%20Mac%20OS%20X>`_, although this can be problematic.

As a solution, it is possible to use a free virtual machine, which has the required software already installed (see the Semi-Automatic OS chapter).
